## **I created a tool to analyze buy-and-rent strategy of the housing market in San Francisco. Using my tool I was able to answer the following questions.**
##

## 1. Question: What is the overall trend in housing_units over the period being analysed?

## Answer: The mean of housing units per year is increasing by roughly 0.5% annualy between 2010 and 2016
##
## 2. Question: What is the lowest gross rent reported for the years included in the DataFrame?

## Answer: 2010 had the lowest gross rent among the years analysed.
##
## 3. Question: Did any year experience a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year?

## Answer: Yes, 2011 was the only yeaer to experience a drop in the annual average sale price per square foot.
##
## 4. Question: If so, did the gross rent increase or decrease during that year?

## Answer: Average annual gross rent for 2011 increased compared to 2010.
##
## 5. Question: For the Anza Vista neighbourhood, is the average sale price per square foot for 2016 more or less than the price thatâ€™s listed for 2012? 

## Answer: Less.
##
## 6. Question: Which neighbourhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?

## Answer: Westwood Park.
##
## 7. Question:  How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighbourhoods across San Francisco?

## Answer: Gross Rent per square meter has been on steep incline over the years. Sale price per square meter did not see such a steep incline, but for almost all neighbourhoods has increased. In some neighbourhoods sales prices decreased over the years.
##
## 8. Question: What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighbourhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?

## Answer: The data demonstrates that gross rent of almost all neighbourhoods has seen a major incline over the years, roughly 400% increase since 2010, which reinforces the buy-and-rent strategy. Although some neighbourhoods saw a decline in sale price over the years, the general overview indicated that sale prices have also risen. Union square district, Corona Heights, Russian Hill and Bernal Heights are among the nieghbourhoods that had a remarkable sale price increase over the years leading to 2016. It is worth noting that the gross rent increase of about 75% per annum was enough to surpassed any losses due to sale prices decrease.
